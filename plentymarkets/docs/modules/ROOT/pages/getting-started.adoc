= Getting started

The following pages will navigate you through the basics of our REST Api.
After the basics, you will find different guides which describe specific use cases consuming the API
or resources.

When developing apps consuming our APIs you might need to check the references for details and mappings.
We provide you a simple reference page, containing the most important api endpoints, and a complex one
containing all of our endpoints.

== OpenAPI format

We want to enhance your workflow with our API. For that reason, we built a whole new internal annotation progress.
At the moment, we deliver a file you can use with your preferred API software. You can checkout our REST-Documentation,
based upon the Swagger-UI, xref:plentymarkets-rest-api:ROOT:index.adoc[here].

You either can download it or check out our link:https://github.com/plentymarkets/api-doc/[GitHub repository].
